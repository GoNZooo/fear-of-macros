Project for consolidating explorations into the world of Racket macros:

Spurred on and named after a tutorial written by Greg Hendershott [greghendershott.com] repository is supposed to be a playground for Racket macros.

Components so far:
	   Language constructs:
	   c-style.rkt		An attempt at (somewhat) replicating integer defines and C-style for-loops.
	   py-style.rkt		An attempt at replicating the iterative binding in python's for-loops.
	   while-attempt.rkt	Just your regular garden variety while-loop.

	   Other:
	   define-test.rkt	An attempt at making unit tests less cumbersome to write by introducing a set of macros for defining them.
	   chapters/*		Code written alongside the tutorial by GHendershott.
